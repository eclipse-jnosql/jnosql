/**
 * This package contains all objects to use a Column Family API. This API has focus in domain, in other words,
 * ubiquitous language. A column family is a NoSQL object that contains columns of related data. It is a tuple (pair)
 * that consists of a key-value pair, where the key is mapped to a value that is a set of columns.
 * In analogy with relational databases, a column family is as a "table", each key-value pair being a "row".
 * Each column is a tuple (triplet) consisting of a column name, a value, and a timestamp. In a relational
 * database table, this data would be grouped together within a table with other non-related data.
